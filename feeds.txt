Title: 7 decades after extinction, cheetahs land in India’s heart
Summary: Seven decades after the last cheetah was hunted to extinction in India, its cousins from Africa are here to take their spot in the Indian sun. On Saturday, PM Modi operated a lever to open a gate and release eight cheetahs into a special enclosure. Jet-lagged after a 9,000-km overnight flight from Namibia to Gwalior, and then to the Kuno helipad, the cheetahs looked at their new surroundings a bit tentatively at first, but were soon sprinting about.
